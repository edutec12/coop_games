# coop_games
The objective of this code is to implement a system that uses cooperative game theory to allocate a fixed amount of power from an electric system to a group of agents and calculates a different tariff for each agent based on their level of consumption and their share of the allocated power. The satisfaction of each agent is calculated based on a satisfaction function that takes into account the price of electricity, the agent's level of consumption, and their comfort level. The algorithm then calculates the total satisfaction of all agents and uses the Shapley value to allocate power to each agent in proportion to their marginal contribution, with the goal of achieving a fair distribution of power among the agents. Finally, the code calculates a different tariff for each agent using different tariff formulas and prints the tariff for each agent.
